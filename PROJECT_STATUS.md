## 🖥️ LOCAL SETUP STATUS

### ✅ Completed Steps
1. ✅ **Node.js Installed** - v24.11.1 successfully installed via winget
2. ✅ **Project Files Ready** - All 73 files in place
3. ✅ **Dependencies Configured** - package.json ready

### ⏳ Remaining Step (1 Simple Action)

**YOU NEED TO**: Restart VS Code

**Why**: The current terminal session was opened BEFORE Node.js was installed, so it can't see the `node` and `npm` commands yet. This is normal Windows behavior.

**How**:
1. Close VS Code completely (File → Exit)
2. Reopen VS Code
3. Open this project folder
4. Tell me "ready"

**Then I'll automatically**:
- ✅ Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- ✅ Start dev server (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Open browser to http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Show you the running admin dashboard!

## 🚀 Alternative: Deploy to Cloud (No Localhost Needed)

If you prefer to skip local setup:

### Backend (30 minutes)
1. Create Supabase account: https://supabase.com
2. Run migrations
3. Deploy Edge Functions
4. Set OpenAI API key

### Admin Panel (15 minutes)
1. Deploy to Vercel: https://vercel.com
2. Set environment variables
3. Done - live URL!

**Guide**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete instructions
