# ✅ Node.js Installed! - Next Step Required

## Current Status

✅ **Node.js has been successfully installed** using Windows Package Manager (winget)!

## ⚠️ One More Step Needed

Your **current terminal session** cannot see Node.js yet because the PATH environment variable needs to be refreshed.

### 🔄 Quick Fix (30 seconds)

**Restart VS Code**:
1. Close VS Code completely (File → Exit)
2. Reopen VS Code
3. Open this project folder again  
4. Type "ready" in chat

### What Happens Next (Automatic)

Once you restart VS Code and say "ready", I will automatically:

1. ✅ Verify Node.js is accessible
2. ✅ Install all admin panel dependencies (`npm install`)
3. ✅ Create environment configuration
4. ✅ Start the development server
5. ✅ Open browser to http://localhost:5173
6. ✅ Show you the running admin dashboard!

### Why This Step is Necessary

Windows terminal sessions don't automatically refresh their environment variables. Restarting VS Code creates a new terminal session that will see the newly installed Node.js.

**Action Required**: Restart VS Code, then type "ready"! 🚀
