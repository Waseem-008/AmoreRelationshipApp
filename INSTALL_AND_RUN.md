# 5-Minute Setup - Run Amora Locally

## Step 1: Install Node.js (2 minutes)

1. **Download**: https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x64.msi
2. **Run the installer** - click Next, Next, Next, Install
3. **Restart this terminal** (or close VS Code and reopen)

## Step 2: I'll Do The Rest

Once Node.js is installed, tell me "Node.js is installed" and I will automatically:
- ✅ Install admin panel dependencies  
- ✅ Set up environment variables
- ✅ Start the development server
- ✅ Open it in your browser

## What You'll Get

A running admin dashboard at `http://localhost:5173` that looks like this:
- Modern dark UI
- Login screen (we'll create a test account)
- Dashboard with metrics
- User/couple/session management

## Alternative: Skip Node.js, See Screenshots

If you don't want to install Node.js right now, I can:
- Generate screenshots of what the admin panel looks like
- Show you the complete codebase structure
- Explain the deployment process

---

**Just let me know**: 
1. "Node.js installed" → I'll set everything up automatically
2. "Show me screenshots" → I'll generate visual demos
3. "Skip to deployment" → I'll guide you through cloud deployment
